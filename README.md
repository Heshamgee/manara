**AWS EC2-based Web Application Architecture (High Availability & Scalability)**

**Project Overview:**
Deploy a simple web application on AWS using EC2 instances. Ensure high availability and scalability using Elastic Load Balancing (ALB) and Auto Scaling Groups (ASG). Follow best practices for compute scalability, security, and cost optimization.

---

**Architecture Components:**

1. **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**

   * Launch and run virtual servers to host the web application.
   * Placed within Auto Scaling Groups for scalability.

2. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**

   * Distributes incoming traffic across EC2 instances.
   * Improves availability and fault tolerance.

3. **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**

   * Automatically adds/removes EC2 instances based on traffic/load.
   * Maintains a minimum and maximum number of instances.

4. **Amazon RDS (Optional)**

   * Managed relational database (MySQL/PostgreSQL).
   * Multi-AZ deployment for high availability.

5. **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**

   * Role-based access control for EC2, RDS, and other AWS resources.
   * Secure access policies for AWS services.

6. **Amazon CloudWatch**

   * Monitor logs, metrics, and alarms.
   * Integrates with Auto Scaling policies.

7. **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)**

   * Sends alerts and notifications based on CloudWatch alarms.

**Learning Outcomes:**

* Understanding of secure and scalable deployment using EC2.
* Implementing ALB for load distribution.
* Using ASG for automatic instance scaling.
* Integrating CloudWatch and SNS for proactive monitoring and alerts.
* Applying IAM best practices for access control.
* Optionally deploying a resilient backend using RDS Multi-AZ.

**Deployment Best Practices:**

* Use launch templates for ASG.
* Set health checks on ALB and ASG.
* Distribute EC2 instances across multiple AZs.
* Regularly review IAM policies.
* Enable enhanced monitoring on EC2 and RDS.

---

**Security Notes:**

* Use Security Groups and NACLs for network-level control.
* Apply IAM roles to EC2 instead of embedding credentials.
* Enable encryption for data at rest and in transit (RDS and ALB).
